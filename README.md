## Plugins
<!--
[coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) Alternative: [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) (unlike coc.nvim, it is written in lua itself)  
-->
[lspconfig.nvim](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig.git)  
[lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)  
[nvim-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua)  
[telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)  
[treesitter.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)  
[catppuccin.nvim](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim) (but searching for some good alternatives)  
#### opinions 
> Never using coc.nvim again it just loads up the RAM with its node processes (trying to be as minimal as possible)

> It must be good to see an LSP (language server protocol) for typescript written purely in some low level language (such as C or Rust) for performance improvements, rather than the recent LSP we have written in typescript <!--, Or it will be of no use because the actual [language server](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server) (which we only have 1, unlike c#) that we currenty have is written itself in typescript, so all together there won't be any significant perfomance improvements. -->

## Font
recent favourite one is `` Cascadia Code `` recommended to download from [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) or from Microsoft [Official releases](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases)
